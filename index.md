### Hate Speech Detection
* Created a tool that predicts whether a given statement is a hate speech (with test acc. of ~71%) to classify tweets.
* Dataset contains over 110K tweets from various sources.
* Data preprocessing includes deletion of unused features while labels from different sources were appropriately changed.
* Built a classifier to fine tune a BERT model usign PyTorch.
* Compared wiht a base model of just all labeled non-hateful.
* Project was carried out to learn the deeper aspects of transformers and LLMs.

### Data Science Salary Estimator
* Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (with MAE ~ 11K) to help data science enthusiasts negotiate their income while job search.
* Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium.
* Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark.
* Optimized Linear, Lasso and Random Forest Regressors using GridSearchCV to get the best model.
* A simple client facing API using Flask.

### Research: Pseudo-Replications Recognition in Image Analysis (Computer Vision)
Created algorithms to recognize cell collision in microscopic images with 92% accuracy. Research was performed in collaboration with University of Mississippi Medical Center for Biomedical image analysis. I built several algorithms that classified the correct cell collisions and alert duplications of those collisions if occurred.

### Rossman Stores Sales Prediction using XGBoost (BI Perspective)
* Created a model that predicts the sales of the rossman stores (with mean average precision of 0.13 ~ kaggle score) located in thousands of different places.
* Data was obtained from kaggle competition of the Rossman Store Sales with an objective to dive deep into the theoretical and practical concepts of XGBoost.
* Engineered features from the dates given to quantify the age of the store and the time since the competition of the store is open.
* Hyperparamter Tuning of XGBoost was performed to get the best parameters possible.

### Drowsiness Detection System using TensorFlow and OpenCV (Computer Vision, Transfer Learning)
* A Computer Vision tool to detect drowsiness in drivers. 
* The system is alerted if the driver is found sleepy/drowsy. 
* The driver is determined sleepy/drowsy if their eyes remain shut for a small threshold amount of time which triggers an alarm to wake the driver up.
* Initially used IMutils for facial detection which resulted in incorrect facial landmark detection multiple times.
* Haarcascades facial landmark detection was used.
* Transfer Learning used from MobileNet.
